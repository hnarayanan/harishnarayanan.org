Harish Narayanan (@copingbear) lovingly crafted this website.

This website is:

- Written in GNU Emacs on macOS
- Generated by Hugo from Markdown content (and some YAML metadata)
- Managed by a Makefile that rsyncs the generated site to a webserver
- Served by NGINX on an Ubuntu VM that’s setup with Ansible
- Built using standard web technologies:
  - HTML (HTML5 Boilerplate)
  - CSS (Skeleton, Pure.css, Ghost’s Casper theme, Normalize.css)
  - JavaScript (highlight.js, MathJax, XTK, jQuery, FitVids.js)
  - SVG (Graphviz)
