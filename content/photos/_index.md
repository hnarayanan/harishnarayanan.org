description: Moments from life.

As a parent, most of the snapshots you’ll find here from the past few
years are of my children. Scroll down a bit further and you’ll find a
small selection of my favourite moments from life before.

The albums below are just a glimpse into my larger photo collection,
which you can find scattered across the web on my [personal
journal](https://emphaticallystatic.org/photos/), [family
blog](https://narayanan.co),
[Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@harish/media) and (previously)
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/copingbear/media).
