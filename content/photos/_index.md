description: Moments from my life.

As a proud parent, you'll notice that most of these snapshots from the
past few years are of my adorable kids. But if you keep scrolling
down, you'll discover a [handful of my personal favorite
memories](/photos/#pre-children) from life before I became a father.

These albums are just a peek into my extensive photo collection, which
you can find all over the web on [my personal
journal](https://emphaticallystatic.org/photos/), [family
blog](https://narayanan.co),
[Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@harish/media) and
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/copingbear/media) (before I took a break
from it). I hope you enjoy browsing through them and getting to know
me and my family a bit better!
