description: Moments from my life.
---

Most of the snapshots you’ll find here from the past few
years are of my children. [Scroll down a bit further](/photos/#pre-children) and you’ll find a
small selection of my favourite moments from life before I was a parent.

These albums are just a glimpse into my larger photo collection, which
you can find scattered across the web on my [personal
journal](https://emphaticallystatic.org/photos/), [family
blog](https://narayanan.co),
[Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@harish/media) and (previously)
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/copingbear/media).
