Nonlinear elasticity theory plays a fundamental role in modelling the
mechanical response of many polymeric and biological materials. Such
materials are capable of undergoing finite deformation, and their
material response is often characterised by complex, nonlinear
constitutive relationships. Because of these difficulties, predicting
the response of such materials to arbitrary loads requires numerical
computation (usually based on the finite element method).

The steps involved in the construction of the required finite element
algorithms are classical and straightforward in principle, but their
application to non-trivial material models are typically tedious and
error-prone. We believe our automated computational framework for
nonlinear elasticity, [CBC.Twist][cbctwist] is an elegant solution to
this problem.

[CBC.Twist][cbctwist] aims to allow researchers to easily pose their
problems in a straightforward manner, so that they may focus on
higher-level modelling questions, without being hindered by specific
implementation issues. It is built atop [the FEniCS project][fenics],
and is collaboratively developed [free software][gnufreesw]. Weâ€™d love
for you to try it and tell us what you think!

The capabilities (and elegance!) of [CBC.Twist][cbctwist] is best
captured in the following example, a [hyperelastic][hyperelastic]
block being twisted by 60 degrees.

````
# Import utility classes from cbc.twist
from cbc.twist import *

# Define the quasi-static hyperelasticity problem
class Twist(StaticHyperelasticity):

    def mesh(self):
        return UnitCube(8, 8, 8)

    def dirichlet_values(self):
        clamp = Expression(("0.0", "0.0", "0.0"))
        twist = Expression(("0.0",
                            "y0+(x[1]-y0)*cos(t)-(x[2]-z0)*sin(t)-x[1]",
                            "z0+(x[1]-y0)*sin(t)+(x[2]-z0)*cos(t)-x[2]"),
                            y0=0.5, z0=0.5, t=pi/3)
        return [clamp, twist]

    def dirichlet_boundaries(self):
        left = "x[0] == 0.0"
        right = "x[0] == 1.0"
        return [left, right]

    def body_force(self):
        B = Expression(("0.0", "0.0", "0.0"))
        return B

    def material_model(self):
        mu = 3.8461
        lmbda = 5.7692
        material = StVenantKirchhoff([mu, lmbda])
        return material

    def __str__(self):
        return "A hyperelastic cube twisted by 60 degrees"

# Setup the problem
twist = Twist()
print twist

# Solve the problem and plot the solution
u = twist.solve()
plot(u)
````

Notice that the code above only contains information directly
pertinent to specification of the mechanics problem. This includes the
definition of the computational domain, material model, boundary
conditions and body forces. The underlying framework parses this
human-readable Python code, automatically performs several steps
(including the most tedious one of them all: linearisation of the
nonlinear problem) and generates efficient C++ code for finite element
computation.

When run, we see quadratic convergence of the Newton-Raphson scheme
used to solve the nonlinear problem and a pretty solution!

But the fun does not stop there. [CBC.Twist][cbctwist] includes a lot
of other nifty features, including:

* Built in support for a large class of material models.
* Easy specification of additional material models using a syntax that
  closely mirrors how continuum mechanics is  posed on paper, e.g.:
````
class MooneyRivlin(MaterialModel):
    """Defines the strain energy function for a (two term)
    Mooney-Rivlin material"""

    def model_info(self):
        self.num_parameters = 2
        self.kinematic_measure = "CauchyGreenInvariants"

    def strain_energy(self, parameters):
        I1 = self.I1
        I2 = self.I2

        [C1, C2] = parameters
        return C1*(I1 - 3) + C2*(I2 - 3)
````
* Support for material heterogeneity (spatially-varying material
  constants).
* Support for time-dependent problems incorporating energy-momentum
  conserving time-stepping schemes.

Additionally, the following extensions are being worked on:

* Support for multiple materials and anisotropy.
* Goal-oriented adaptivity.
* Introducing coupling with other physics (including fluid-solid
  interaction).
