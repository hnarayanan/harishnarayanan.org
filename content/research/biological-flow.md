Accurate and efficient modelling of biomedical flows is of substantial
interest because of its immediate applicability to a variety of
fields, including the design of medical devices, the planning of
surgical procedures and most fundamentally, the scientific
understanding of healthy and diseased biological function. The
complexity in this problem arises from the fact that
physically-interesting flows occur in complex, patient-specific
geometries and often occur in conjunction with other physics such as
the finite deformation of the vascular walls and biochemical
reaction-diffusion processes.

The primary aim of our research is the development of a robust
computational framework for biomedical flow simulation and apply it to
our current problem of interest: understanding how blood flow in an
artery affects the formation and growth of
[aneurysms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneurysm).

Such a problem motivates the need for accurate computation of
quantities that are implicated in the growth of aneurysms (such as
the shear forces exerted by the blood flow on their vessel walls and
the stretch of the arterial walls due to normal pressure). We term
these quantities of interest, "goal quantities." Central to computing
these quantities accurately are adaptive mesh techniques based on _a
posteriori_ error estimates, which rely on estimates of the errors in
computed physical goal quantities to determine regions where the error
needs to be reduced. These estimates are calculated from the computed
solution and the solution of an auxiliary (dual) problem containing
information about the stability of the flow equations being solved and
the goal quantity expressed as a functional. Briefly, we use the fact
that the error in the specified goal functional is the residual of the
dual solution:

\begin{align}
\mathcal{M}(u_{h}) - \mathcal{M}(u)
& = \mathcal{M}(u_{h} - u)\\
& = a^{*}(z, u_{h} - u)\\
& = a(u_{h} - u, z)\\
& = a(u_{h}, z) - a(u, z)\\
& = a(u_{h}, z) - L(z)\\
& = r(z),
\end{align}

I've given about this to better clarify concepts and see how we apply
this general theory to equations modelling fluid flow. Applying our
adaptive scheme to a 2D representation of an aneurysm results first in
a simulation of the blood flow through the diseased vessel.

It also results in the construction of optimal computational meshes,
which allow us to compute quantities related to aneurysm growth to a
specified accuracy requirement with minimal computational work. Notice
that the optimal mesh changes with the goal of our computation.

Algorithmic and software design lessons learnt from this project have
been incorporated into [CBC.Flow](https://launchpad.net/cbc.solve), a
Python application written atop the [FEniCS
Project](https://fenicsproject.org/) and distributed under the GNU
GPL. It allows a user to easily pose and solve fluid flow problems
with a syntax that is close to our automated hyperelasticity solver,
[CBC.Twist](/research/automated-mechanics/). The
following is an example.
