description: A summary of my academic research spanning continuous field theory, numerical algorithms, and a range of applications in biophysics.

For the decade prior to becoming an entrepreneur (2002â€”2012), I
enjoyed the lifestyle of a curious academic. My research in this
period was motivated by a range of applications in biophysics, and
focused on continuum field theory and numerical algorithms. This page
links to [descriptions of my work](#areas), and serves as a sampling
of my [scientific writing](#writing) and [talks](#talks).
