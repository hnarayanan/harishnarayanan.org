description: A summary of my academic research spanning continuous field theory, numerical algorithms, and a range of applications in biophysics.

Before I became an entrepreneur in 2012, I spent a wonderful decade
living the life of a curious academic. During that time, I delved deep
into continuum field theory and numerical algorithms. My focus was on
applications in biophysics. If you're interested, I've provided some
links on this page that [showcase my work](#areas), including some of
my [scientific writing](#writing) and [talks](#talks). Feel free to
take a look!
