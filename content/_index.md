title: Hi! I‚Äôm Harish Narayanan
description: Dr. Harish Narayanan is a London-based applied mathematician, computational biologist and maker of fine web applications.

I'm a London-based co-parent to [two adorable
boys](https://narayanan.co). I'm [trained in scientific
computing](/research/) and make [beautiful things on the
web](/projects/) for a living.

## Professionally...

I'm one of the founders of a fintech startup[^1] named
[Edgefolio](https://edgefolio.com/). Our company creates web-based
tools that connect institutional investors and hedge funds. For my day
job, I spend a lot of time thinking about what the *right things to
create* are, and growing teams to build these things.

When I'm not on the job, I take on [exploratory projects](/projects/)
that align with my passion for using techology to make the world a
better place. I learn a lot while doing this, and share what I learn
through [my writing](/writing/), talks and [open source
projects](https://github.com/hnarayanan).

Right now, I'm working on two projects that reflect this passion. The
first is called [Scancer](https://scancer.org/about/), which is all
about making early detection of breast cancer more accessible. The
second project is [HERO Index](http://www.heroindex.io/), a platform
that assists you in investing based on your personal values. Both of
these projects rely on recent AI[^2] technology to solve problems that
were once impossible for computers to tackle.

I'm also delving deeper into some fascinating ideas involving using
neural networks to solve differential equations. It's a highly
efficient method that has the potential to revolutionise the way we
design and control systems in challenging fields like biomedicine and
energy.

Although I'm still in the early stages and have only been doing a lot
of doodling on paper, I'm incredibly excited about this work and would
love to make it my life's focus.&nbsp;ü¶Ñ

## Personally...

I love taking photos (*who doesn't?*) and [publish some of it
online](/photos/). More recently, I've been toying with AI models to
[style images](writing/artistic-style-transfer/) and [generate
art](/projects/#art). I very much enjoy programmatically generating
thousands of different variants and hand-selecting a bunch to form
collections.

{{< figure-2x src1="/images/photos/hugo.jpg" href1="/photos/" title1="Photos, mostly of my kids." src2="/images/projects/women-in-saris/women-in-saris.png" href2="/projects/#art" title2="AI-generated illustrations.">}}

I'm also very into music (I love to sing! üé§), and I'm internet famous[^3] for a
tool I made some years ago called
[Shpotify](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify). Shpotify lets you
control the music app Spotify from the command line on a Mac. Oh, you
could say I'm a bit of a nerd! ü§ì

{{< figure src="/images/projects/shpotify.png" href="https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify" title="A command-line interface for Spotify on a Mac.">}}

As you might be gathering, I've always had a passion for learning and
creating things, which has given me a sense of purpose. However, as
I've grown older, I've come to value the connections I make with
others and the opportunities to help people more than ever before.
Whether it's spending time with my children, volunteering in my
community[^4], mentoring students, or [supporting children at an
orphanage close to my
heart](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipN41pxW2Dkv3XHWNCJnISs2ZQROKayYcPFFcxidfvk9TvOYxgaZgsPMmmiYqNjsUA?key=aEZpdGx1ai1paEx4VXBmY21NaUx2am9PTTBnTzVn),
I'm constantly seeking ways to build stronger social connections and
make a positive impact in the lives of others.

On a more personal note, I've been on a journey of growth and healing
since my marriage ended. This experience has empowered me in so many
ways. I've reignited my love for [journaling on paper](https://hachyderm.io/@harish/110007235998489508) and [writing for
myself](https://emphaticallystatic.org) on the web. I've even been brainstorming ideas for a [text-based
app that fosters community building](https://github.com/textually-app/community). Most importantly, I'm feeling
creatively charged, energised, and excited about the possibility of
[finding my forever person](/date-me/). ‚ù§Ô∏è

### And in conclusion...

We've covered a lot of ground, haven't we? Thank you for sticking
around. If you're interested in getting to know me on a personal
level, feel free to browse more of this site. Better yet, let's [go on
a date](/date-me/)! And if you're considering working with me, please
take a look at [some of my other projects](/projects/). Either way,
don't hesitate to [get in touch](mailto:mail@harishnarayanan.org). I'd
love to connect with you.
