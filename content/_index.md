heading: Hi, I'm Harish!

I live in London and I am the proud parent of two adorable boys. I'm
[trained in scientific computing](/research/) and make [beautiful
things on the web](/projects/) for a living.

I have always loved learning new things. For my day job, I'm one of
the founders of a fintech startup[^1] called
[Edgefolio](https://edgefolio.com/). In this context, I think a lot
about what the *right things* to build are, and growing teams to build
these things.

Outside this, I am usually working on a handful of projects of
interest to me.

I'm really passionate about using cutting-edge technology to make a
positive impact on the world. Right now, I'm working on two projects
that reflect this passion. The first is called
[Scancer](https://scancer.org/about/), which is all about making early
detection of breast cancer more accessible. The second project is
[HERO Index](http://www.heroindex.io), a platform that helps you
invest based on your personal values. Both of these projects rely on
the latest AI[^2] technology to solve problems that were once
impossible for computers to tackle.

Delving deeper into related tech, I am exploring using neural networks
to solve differential equations. This is a fast and efficient method
that can help design and control systems in challenging environments,
like biomedicine and energy. Though I haven't made much progress yet
beyond a lot of doodling on paper, I would like to make it my life's
work.

I'm very into music (I love to sing! üé§), and I'm internet famous[^3] for a
tool I made some years ago called
[Shpotify](https://github.com/hnarayanan/shpotify). Shpotify lets you
control the music app Spotify from the command line on a Mac. Yes, I
am a bit of a nerd.

I also love taking photos (who doesn't?) and publish some of it
online. More recently, I've been toying with AI models to style images
and generate art. I very much enjoy programmatically generating
thousands of different variants and hand-selecting a bunch to form a
collection.

As I get older, I find myself valuing connecting with and
helping people more and more. Whether it's spending time with my
children, volunteering, mentoring students, or supporting kids at an
orphanage in my hometown, I'm always looking for ways to make a
positive impact.

I've been on a journey of growth and healing since my marriage ended,
and it's empowered me in so many ways. Now, I'm feeling creative,
energised, and excited to [find my forever person](/date-me/). ‚ù§Ô∏è

Wow, we've covered *a lot* of ground. Thank you for sticking around.
If you'd like to get to know me personally, you can [read 
more](/date-me/), or even better, let's go on a date! If you think you
might be intereted in working with me, please do check out [more of my
projects](/projects/). Either way, please don't hesitate to reach out.
I'm excited to get to know you too.


[^1]: I say "startup," but it's over ten years old now and standing on
    its own feet! üí´
[^2]: Convolutional neural networks and large transformer models,
    respectively.
[^3]: This tool that I first built in a weekend has like tens of
    thousands of downloads, whereas my Ph.D. thesis that took 5 years
    to write has maybe been read by 5 people. *Including me.*

    <h1 id="main-description">Hi, I‚Äôm Harish Narayanan</h1>
    <p>I‚Äôm a scientific computing Ph.D. who loves learning about and building sophisticated web apps. My focus at the moment is on applications of deep learning, and understanding how to build reliable distributed systems. I share what I learn through <a href="/writing/">my writing</a>, talks and <a href="/projects/">open source projects</a>.</p>
    <p>If this stuff is exciting to you too, do <a href="mailto:mail@harishnarayanan.org">get in touch</a>!</p>
    <p>I‚Äôm currently one of the founders at <a href="https://edgefolio.com/">Edgefolio</a>, a startup building effective solutions for different stakeholders in the asset management industry. My everyday work involves defining innovative products, shipping high-quality code, and growing and leading a team. Previously, I was an applied mathematician and computational biologist studying a range of <a href="/research/">interesting problems in biophysics</a>. You can find out more about my professional history on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drharishnarayanan">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
    <p>In addition to delving into new fields and growing a startup, these past few years have seen me becoming the father of <a href="https://narayanan.co/">two cute baby boys</a>.</p>
    <p><a href="https://hachyderm.io/@harish">Being silly on Mastodon</a> is how I cope with the excitement of it all.</p>
