    <h1 id="main-description">Hi, I’m Harish Narayanan</h1>
    <p>I’m a computational science Ph.D. who loves learning about and building sophisticated web apps. My focus at the moment is on applications of deep learning, and understanding how to build reliable distributed systems. I share what I learn through <a href="/writing/">my writing</a>, talks and <a href="/projects/">open source projects</a>.</p>
    <p>If this stuff is exciting to you too, do <a href="mailto:mail@harishnarayanan.org">get in touch</a>!</p>
    <p>I’m currently one of the founders at <a href="https://edgefolio.com/">Edgefolio</a>, a startup building effective solutions for different stakeholders in the hedge fund industry. My everyday work involves defining products, shipping high-quality code, and growing and leading a team. Previously, I was an applied mathematician and computational biologist studying a range of <a href="/research/">interesting problems in biophysics</a>. You can find out more about my professional history on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/drharishnarayanan">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
    <p>In addition to delving into new fields and growing a startup, these past couple of years have seen me getting married to a lovely woman, moving countries, and becoming the father to a <a href="http://narayanan.co/">cute baby boy</a>.</p>
