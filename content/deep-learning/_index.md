*Deep learning* is a family of computational methods that solve
problems that sound *intuitive* when stated, like recognising a face
in an image, but where it's hard to explicitly write down all the
steps a computer needs to follow to solve them. These methods work by
allowing computers to learn from experience, whereby they build an
understanding of the world in terms of a hierarchy of increasingly
sophisticated concepts. Deep learning methods have dramatically
improved the state-of-the-art in [many application
domains][applications]: from voice-based virtual assistants, to
dermatologist-level classification of skin cancer, to self-driving
automobiles.

This learning pathway strings together the best resources on the
web to help you learn deep learning. It covers a lot of ground,
starting with some broad background in programming and mathematics,
and works its way to research-level applications of deep
learning.

If you're coming in with some knowledge of programming and
mathematics, you can skip ahead in this pathway and complete it in a
few months of part time study. If you're coming in as a complete
novice, this material will take a lot longer to cover. But do not be
discouraged, [ask for help as you need it][discussions]. Things will
begin to get clearer as you systematically work through the material.

If you'd like to suggest additions or improvements to this learning
pathway, please open [an issue][gh-issue] or a [pull request][gh-pr]
on GitHub. Note that I only incorporate material that I have
thoroughly gone through, so please be patient.

Happy learning!

### Machine Learning in General

TODO: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. Before you jump to deep
learning, you might want to brush up on the broader fundamentals of
machine learning. Here are two classes that offer an excellent
introduction. You can pick either one as a starting point.
