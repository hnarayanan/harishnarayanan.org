description: A collection of my writing on technology.

I'm usually playing with a handful of technologies at any given
time. At the moment these include Kubernetes, TensorFlow, Go, Swift
and Scheme. The articles below are an attempt to share some of the
insights I've gathered along the way. They each contain a healthy mix
of theoretical background and practical examples.

If you're looking for my more formal writing on computational science,
head on over to the [relevant section of the research
page][academic-writing]. Or if that's not your cup of tea, do feel
free to sample [some entries from my personal
journal][personal-journal-featured].
