TODO: A summary, describing why this is interesting and
feasible. Something suitable for a general audience.

## Gathering data

- TODO: Describe how 2+ sources can be  connected and imported using
  Pandas -> Django/PostgreSQL.
- TODO: Explain the use of indexing, either using PostgreSQL or
  Elasticsearch, for fast querying

## Description

- TODO: Generate some interactive graphs (e.g. in D3.js) to describe
  the data. The target is to reproduce the plots from 1--2 reference
  articles, but making them interactive SVGs

- TODO: Motivate the facets we're going to use to guide the upcoming
  machine learning alogorithm.

## Machine learning for prediction

- TODO: Describe the algorithm from the Imperial College paper.
- TODO: Give a brief primer for TensorFlow.
- TODO: Provide some results of the prediction, visualized in the same
  way as the descriptive look at the data earlier.

## Conclusion

- TODO: Discuss any interesting tidbits from results.
- TODO: Summarise tools used.
- TODO: Point to related source code repository for replicating and
  expanding upon this work. Suggest extensions, both to modelling and
  to visualisation.
