Hello! Thank you so much for stopping by and reading this page. My
name is Harish and I'm a 42-year old single father of two young boys
living in London. I separated on good terms with my ex and I have my
children for about half the time.

I am a nerdy person who has studied a lot and make a living making
silly things on the web. I do some of this in the context of a company
I co-created, and it's going surprisingly well after years of toil.

I am looking for a deep and lifelong relationship with a woman (either
cis or trans). I am especially drawn to gentle and creative people,
and I have a dream where I make cute and meaningful things with my
partner as we go through life. I also fantasise about singing
together, as it is something that gives me a lot of joy.

I have an introverted personality. I very much prefer tiny intimate
groups to busy social situations. My mental health has not been the
greatest over time, but I have worked seriously on myself through
therapy and reading and introspection, aiming to be a kinder and
gentler human being. I do believe this is who I am today.

I've been a lifelong vegetarian for cultural reasons, and I am
naturally tending vegan on some days just by happenstance. Given my
age, I am not sure I have the energy to have any more biological
children but I'd be delighted to help care for yours if you already
have some.

I'm so glad you made it to the end of this page. If you'd like to get
to know me better, please do write to me.
