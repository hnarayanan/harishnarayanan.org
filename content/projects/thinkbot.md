thinkbot has been a labour of love of mine for some years now. In this
period, I've gone through a bunch of experimentation that's helped me
better clarify my vision for the project. All of this is starting to
feel well-formed in my head, and what follows is a bit of a manifesto.

At its core, thinkbot is a platform that allows computational
scientists to easily package and run their code on the cloud. This
makes high performance computing a commodity, and has obvious
implications for the reproducibility and collaborative evolution of
computational science.

The project will be developed in the open, and released under a
liberal open source license. It will have a strong code of
conduct that encourages a helpful, inclusive and kind community around
it.

thinkbot's technical design is heavily inspired by projects like Deis
and openshift, and will leverage Kubernetes at its core. Atop this
core platform, there'll exist a general purpose REST/RPC/WebSockets
layer that easily allows for things like iOS UIs.

It'll be awesome and I'm excited.
