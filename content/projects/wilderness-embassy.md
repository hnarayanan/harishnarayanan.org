Wilderness Embassy aimed to be an engaging website to help children
learn more about the relationship between humans, animals and our
planet. It suggested fun activities for parents and teachers to do
with children in nature, and housed a collection of fictional stories
featuring cute characters encouraging children to explore and learn
about their environment.

The project was the brainchild of [Tiril
Bryn](https://www.facebook.com/tiril.bryn), a friend I made at a
weekend event where people were offering their skills to make the
world a better place. And the illustrations above are by Mia
Sk√•re. This project was my first foray into web development for a
non-technical audience, and it was where I first learnt to work with
[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org).

It has since morphed into more of a book.
