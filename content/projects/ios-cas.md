One of the first things I did upon getting an iPhone last year was to
fork over an additional $99 to [Apple Developer
Connection](https://developer.apple.com), to get access to their iOS
development tools and the _right to run my own apps on my own
phone_. This has been exciting because programming for the phone has
involved learning a lot: a whole new programming paradigm, touch-based
UI design, a new programming language and a host of new APIs. It is in
the midst of all this manic learning that I started working in earnest
on my first iOS app: an as-yet unnamed computer algebra system.

Its backend symbolic algebra engine is powered by
[GiNaC](https://www.ginac.de/) and frontend equation renderer is
[MathJax](https://code.google.com/archive/p/mathjax-ios/). While the core
functionality has been in place for some time now, I am still trying
to arrive at an intuitive user interface. If you have any ideas, I'm
all ears!
