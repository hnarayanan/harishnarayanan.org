Much of my time over the years has been spent merrily making and
improving the sorts of [websites](#websites) and [software
utilities](#software) you see on this page. I used to build these for
fun alongside my [research software](/research/#areas) for many years,
until one day they started paying the bills! If you’d like to learn
more about or collaborate on any of these projects, [I’d love to hear
from you](mailto:mail@harishnarayanan.org).
